1. Updated signatures for August 2023 Roblox update

2. Added Alt-Enter Fix setting, which sets the FFlagHandleAltEnterFullscreenManually flag in ClientAppSettings.json

3. Added Revert Flags on Close advanced setting (default on), which will reset any flags written by RFU to their default values upon exit

4. Bugfix: Toggling off Unlock Roblox Player or Unlock Roblox Studio will reset the FPS caps of previously attached processes

5. Bugfix: Fix RFU abort/crash that occurred when unlocking Roblox Studio

6. REMINDER: Use of the Memory Write unlock mode with Roblox's Hyperion-protected client is unstable and not recommended. It may work sometimes, but expect crashes and Failed to get process base/Unable to find TaskScheduler/Variable scan failed errors.
